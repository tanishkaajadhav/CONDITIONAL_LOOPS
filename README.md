(a) PRINT EVEN VALUES BETWEEN 0 AND 10 – EVENWHILE.CPP, EVENFOR.CPP

AIM:

To print all even numbers between 0 and 10 using loops in C++.

APPARATUS:

Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:

Loops allow repetitive execution of a block of code. A for or while loop can be used to iterate through numbers and check whether each number is divisible by 2 to identify even numbers.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Declare a variable for iteration.

Use a loop from 0 to 10:

Check if the current number % 2 == 0 → Even

Print the number if it is even

Repeat until the loop ends.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:

The program successfully prints all even numbers between 0 and 10 using loops.

(b) USE A FOR LOOP TO PRINT “SIT" 5 TIMES – SIT.CPP

AIM:

To print the word “SIT” five times using a for loop.

APPARATUS:

Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:

The for loop allows repeating a block of code a specified number of times. By setting the loop counter from 1 to 5, the program can print “SIT” exactly five times.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Use a for loop with counter from 1 to 5.

Inside the loop, print “SIT”.

Repeat until the loop ends.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:

The program successfully prints “SIT” five times using a for loop.

(c) PATTERNPRINTING1.CPP

AIM:

To print a descending star pattern with decreasing stars each row.

APPARATUS:

Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:

Nested loops can be used to print patterns. The outer loop controls the rows, and the inner loop prints stars and spaces. Adjusting the number of spaces and stars allows different triangular patterns.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Accept user input for the number of rows.

Use an outer loop for each row.

Use inner loops to print spaces and stars in descending order.

Repeat until all rows are printed.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:

The program successfully prints descending star patterns using nested loops.

(d) PATTERNPRINTING2.CPP

AIM:

To print an ascending star pattern with increasing stars each row.

APPARATUS:

Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:

Nested loops allow printing increasing star patterns. The outer loop controls rows, and the inner loop prints stars in increasing order.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Accept user input for the number of rows.

Use an outer loop for each row.

Use an inner loop to print stars increasing with each row.

Repeat until all rows are printed.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:

The program successfully prints ascending star patterns using nested loops.

(e) REVERSENO.CPP

AIM:

To reverse a given number and display the reversed digits.

APPARATUS:

Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:

A number can be reversed by repeatedly extracting the last digit using modulus (%) and removing it using integer division (/).

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Declare a variable for the number.

Accept user input for the number.

Use a loop to extract last digit and build the reversed number.

Display the reversed number.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:

The program successfully reverses a number using loops and arithmetic operations.

(f) PASSWORD.CPP

AIM:

To verify a password entered by the user.

APPARATUS:

Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:

Strings can be compared in C++ using the equality operator (==). Decision statements allow the program to determine if the entered password matches the predefined correct password.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Declare a variable to store the password.

Accept user input for the password.

Compare entered password with the correct password.

Display appropriate message.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:

The program successfully verifies passwords using string comparison and decision statements.

(g) HELLOWORLD.CPP

AIM:

To print “Hello, World!” a specified number of times.

APPARATUS:

Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:

A loop can be used to repeat output multiple times. By using a counter in the loop, each repetition can be numbered.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Accept the number of times to print the message.

Use a loop to print “Hello, World!” with numbering.

Repeat until the loop ends.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:

The program successfully prints “Hello, World!” multiple times using loops.

(h) PATTERNPRINTING3.CPP

AIM:

To print a right-angled triangle pattern with increasing stars aligned to the right.

APPARATUS:

Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:

Nested loops can be used to print right-aligned patterns by combining spaces and stars.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Accept number of rows.

Use outer loop for rows.

Use inner loops for spaces and stars to create right alignment.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:

The program successfully prints a right-aligned triangle pattern using nested loops.

(i) PATTERNPRINTING4.CPP

AIM:

To print a right-aligned triangle pattern with increasing stars separated by spaces.

APPARATUS:

Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:

Nested loops allow printing patterns by controlling spaces and stars in each row.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Accept number of rows.

Use outer loop for rows.

Use inner loops to print spaces and stars separated by spaces.
